Topics in Education.
In this section, I will post some findings about my own research on the economics of education in Mexico. I start with some basic models of education and human capital and their applications to Mexican data. Throughout the exposition of these models and applications I explain some difficulties and interesting findings for future research. Additionally, I provide a summary of the state of the art in the main research areas of the economics of education and human capital theory.
